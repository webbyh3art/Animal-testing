ly Drosophila melanogaster identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes,[10][11] and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries "helped transform biology into an experimental science".[12] Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin[13][14] and the 1922 discovery of insulin[15] and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death.[16] Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.[17] Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques,[18][19][20][21] the heart-lung machine,[22] antibiotics,[23][24] and the whooping cough vaccine.[25]

Animal testing is widely used to aid in research of human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical.[26] This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.[27] Performing experiments in model organisms allows for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology as needed. Biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, and care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another.[28][page needed] However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models.[29][30] Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies,[31] anthrax,[31] glanders,[31] feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV),[32] tuberculosis,[31] Texas cattle fever,[31] classical swine fever (hog cholera),[31] heartworm, and other parasitic infections.[33] Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research,[34] and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease,[35] AIDS,[36] multiple sclerosis,[37] spinal cord injury, many headaches,[38] and other conditions in which there is no useful in vitro model system available.

The annual use of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—was estimated at 192 million as of 2015.[39] In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research,[39] and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011.[40] The mouse (Mus musculus) is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries,[41] and by one estimate, the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million.[42] In 2013, it was reported that mammals (mice and rats), fish, amphibians, and reptiles together accounted for over 85% of research animals.[43] In 2022, a law was passed in the United States that eliminated the FDA requirement that all drugs be tested on animals.[44]

Animal testing is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.[45] In some cases it is strictly controlled while others have more relaxed regulations. There are ongoing debates about the ethics and necessity of animal testing. Proponents argue that it has led to significant advancements in medicine and other fields while opponents raise concerns about cruelty towards animals and question its effectiveness and reliability.[46][47] There are efforts underway to find alternatives to animal testing 

Definitions
The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, in vivo testing, and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations. Literally, "vivisection" means "live sectioning" of an animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals",[52][53][54] although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is "used only by people who are opposed to such work".[55][56] The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death.[57] The word "vivisection" is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term "animal experimentation".[58][59]
